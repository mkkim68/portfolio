    introduction: {
      p1: "Hi, I’m Minkyoung Kim, a frontend developer based in Korea. I was originally an Electronic Engineering major, and my first encounter with programming came through basic major courses. While the curriculum focused heavily on hardware, I found myself far more interested in the logic and problem-solving aspects of software. At some point, I realized that what truly excited me wasn’t circuits or signals, but building things through code — especially things users could directly interact with. That realization led me to shift my career path toward software development.",
      p2: "Since then, I’ve been focusing on strengthening my skills through intensive study and a developer bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in web development and frontend engineering. I enjoy turning ideas into interactive, well-structured user experiences, and I’m constantly exploring better ways to build maintainable and scalable interfaces.",
